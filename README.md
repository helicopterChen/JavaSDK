Java SDK for PlayFab README
========
1. Overview:
----
This document describes the process of configuring and building the PlayFab Java SDK.


2. Prerequisites:
----
* Users should be very familiar with the topics covered in our [getting started guide](https://playfab.com/docs/getting-started-guide/).

To connect to the PlayFab service, your machine must be running TLS v1.2 or better.
* For Windows, this means Windows 7 and above
* [Official Microsoft Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380516%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
* [Support for SSL/TLS protocols on Windows](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaushal/archive/2011/10/02/support-for-ssl-tls-protocols-on-windows.aspx)


3. Source Code & Key Repository Components:
----
This package contains three different versions of the PlayFab SDK.
* PlayFabClientSDK - This version contains only client libraries and is designed for integration with your game client
* PlayFabServerSDK - Contains server and admin APIs designed to be called from your custom logic server or build process
* PlayFabSDK - Contains all APIs in one SDK.


4. Installation & Configuration Instructions:
----

The playfab API source code is located within:

    {JavaSDK-Location}/PlayFabSDK/src/playfab

The playfab API relies on the Google gson library, located within:

    {JavaSDK-Location}/PlayFabSDK/src/com

To create a new project using PlayFab, copy the indicated playfab and com directories into the source directory for your project.


4b. Using the example project:
----

The PlayFabApiTest example project can be run from the console.  These instructions assume Windows operating system.

* Extract the JavaSDK Sdk to your computer (referenced as {JavaSDK-Location} within this document)
* Navigate to: {JavaSDK-Location}/PlayFabSDK/src
* Open {JavaSDK-Location}/PlayFabSDK/src/RunPfTests.bat in a text editor such as Notepad++ or FlashDevelop (Regular notepad may not load unix line endings properly)
* Update the titleData path in your RunPfTests.bat file:
 * java -DtestTitleData=C:\depot\pf-main\tools\SDKBuildScripts\testTitleData.json ... etc
 * You will need to create a new testTitleData.json file, and change the above path to match your new file (see next section for details)
* Executing RunPfTests.bat should compile the example project, execute the project, make a handful of API calls, and exit
 * This uses the standard JUnit testing suite
 * The exit code for the example will be 0 for success, or non-zero for failure
 * Detailed info about test failures will be in the console output (stdout)
